# StrongAppAnalytics

This will become a tiny webpage/web 'app' where I can upload my gym workouts (exported by "Strong" app) and I can see my weights progression.
I've also added a calendar and the ability to see more than 1 excercise on the chart (using chartJS and react-calendar).

What motivated me to create this is first and foremost my own personal needs/use.

This is still in-progress.
